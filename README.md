# Friday Night Funkin' - Ghosted Engine

This engine is based on Psych Engine

***Ghosted Engine is an engine that brings many QOL and gameplay elements to FNF with mod support and shaders.***

## Installation:

You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/AndreiRudenko/linc_luajit ` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA\_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

You also have to install djFlixel:Â <span class="colour" style="color:rgb(238, 255, 255)">haxelib git djFlixel [https://github.com/john32b/djFlixel](https://github.com/john32b/djFlixel)</span>
